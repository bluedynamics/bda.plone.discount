Restrictions with souper.plone
------------------------------

- Make sure you do not move discount rules soup away from portal root. This
  will end up in unexpected behavior and errors.


TODO
----

- Currently discount is calculated from net prices. Make it possible to control
  whether discount should be calculated from gross prices.

- Implement Vouchers / Coupons.

- Implement "block neighbor" flag and consider neighbor rules as well as
  parental rules.

- Implement portal type filter in cart discount rules. Usecase is to discount
  by overall items of same type in cart.
